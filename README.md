Tips for Urban Gardening
Choose the Right Containers: Use pots or vertical planters to maximize space.
Opt for Dwarf Varieties: Select smaller plant varieties that are suitable for container gardening.
Utilize Vertical Space: Install shelves or hanging planters to grow herbs or flowers.
Consider Sunlight: Ensure your plants receive adequate light; some may require full sun, while others thrive in partial shade.
Use Quality Soil: Invest in good potting mix that retains moisture and provides nutrients.
Water Wisely: Avoid overwatering by checking soil moisture; use self-watering pots if possible.
Rotate Crops: Change plant types in containers to maintain soil health and reduce pests.
